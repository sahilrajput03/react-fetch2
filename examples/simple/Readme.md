# Developer:

Simply use `npm i` to start this simple app. Note its configured to use local files of `react-fetch2` instead of npm's registry.

For development you can simply run `npm i` and it should use the local version of react-fetch2 instead of the one from npm's registry.

Achived to get local version of `react-fetch2` in this app by using command `npm i ../../` , and it added the same to `package.json` file. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8089029/10012446)
